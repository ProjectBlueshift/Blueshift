/**
 * Thread list to allow task execution in a shared thread scaled with removal
 *
 * <p>Allows assignment of a worker to the user.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is a concurrency baseline used in Trident. Anywhere there needs to be threads, the ConcurrentTaskExecutor
 * is the go-to class for thread pooling and task execution. This class serves the purpose to provide a fixed thread
 * pool whose function is optimized task execution concurrently, as the name suggests. The motivation behind extensive
 * testing and optimization of this class is to improve the existing executor framework to execute tasks with lower
 * submission latency, and the fact that the entire concurrency design falls upon this single class to keep up with the
 * demands of the server.</p>
 *
 * <p>Task metrics are performed in each worker in order to balance task execution between the threads in the pool.
 * Thread confinement and consistency can be achieved by acquiring a single internal worker thread, which provides the
 * necessary methods and external handling within the pool to allow the request to keep executing tasks on the worker
 * while still having the same balancing scalability provided by the distributed {@link #execute(Runnable)} method.</p>
 *
 * <p>A different approach is used to task execution by the workers. Instead of using a linked concurrent collection,
 * which increases the latency between submission and execution phases of the task, the worker stores tasks queued to
 * execute using an {@link java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue}. This suppresses GC overhead and latency by direct
 * array store instead of node linking. Albeit fast, linked collections do not out perform an array based queue under
 * realistic server load. However, because array based queues cannot resize, they are fixed at a default 20000000
 * tasks.
 * The resulting drawback is limited task size. In response, a second linked collection which is used for overflow
 * tasks
 * and checked every other iteration of the task executor. However, due to the improved latency of task execution, the
 * likelihood of a task ever reaching this collection is very small under normal server load.</p>
